# thinmatrix-opengl-3d-game-tutorial-cpp-sdl2
My implementation of ThinMatrix OpenGL 3D Game Tutorial, in C++ and SDL2.

The tutorial's playlist is on the ThinMatrix youtube channel at

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&index=1&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP

I'm attempting translate the LWJGL code to C++. The implementation will aim to
get the OpenGL specific parts working flawlessly as the tutorial is mainly about
OpenGL. The program structure, classes etc. will be like in the tutorial, but
might be a bit different in case I find that convenient.

The target platform is Linux. To compile the program cd to src and run make.
